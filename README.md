# üß† GuruAssist: AI-Powered Mind Map Generator

GuruAssist is a smart learning tool that transforms your syllabus or study notes into interactive, explorable mind maps. Built with Streamlit and powered by OpenAI GPT4o-mini model, it helps you visualize complex topics, understand relationships between concepts, and dive deep into subjects on demand.

*Replace this with a GIF or screenshot of your application in action!*

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual Input Methods**: Generate mind maps from either a **PDF file** or by **pasting raw text**.
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Leverages the OpenAI API to intelligently analyze your content and build a hierarchical mind map.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore your mind map with a dynamic, zoomable, and draggable interface.
- **Click-to-Learn**: Click on any topic (node) in the mind map to get an instant, AI-generated summary, key points, and examples.
- **Recursive Drill-Down**: Not enough detail? Select any topic and generate a brand new, more focused mind map for it.
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Keep track of your learning path as you drill down into sub-topics.
